Expected 3hr; actual much longer
*Tried to subclass Variable.java again into x, y, etc. to get rid of the
 if tree checking for independent variables.  Doing this screwed up a
 lot of stuff which I couldn't really figure out how to fix and made it
 difficult to distinguish between independent variables and let variables
 with the same name as independent variables.  In the end I just kept the
 tree but created a mapping class so Variable wasn't storing and passing
 other Variables depending on if they were let variable mappings.
 
 No consultation/written resources/test files/IO files
 
 Some extra info on regular expressions when adding new functions would
 have been helpful for this assignment.
